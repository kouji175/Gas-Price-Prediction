# Gas-Price-Prediction

## Overview
This project is focused on predicting natural gas prices using advanced time series analysis techniques, aiming to provide accurate forecasts that can be beneficial for various stakeholders in planning and decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset, named `Nat_Gas.csv`, contains historical prices of natural gas along with their corresponding dates. Ensure this file is in the correct path or modify the path in the notebook accordingly.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following packages:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Features
The project includes the following features:

- Loading and preprocessing of natural gas price data.
- Visualization of price trends over time.
- Implementation of linear regression to capture the overarching trend.
- Fitting a sinusoidal function to capture seasonal variations.
- Interpolation and extrapolation of the model for future price prediction.
